You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  

* What new skills have you learned?
  I have learned html tagging, how to open a website on a local computer, and that you can download Chrome on a MAC.  I have also learned about Atom and Sublime.

* What has been easy?

Html tagging seems pretty straightforward so far.

* What has been difficult?

The full functionality of Atom seems a little difficult so far.

 * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

 I have googled for proper coding on the projects and quizzes noting some elements are deprecated.
